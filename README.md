Brimstone is a semi-automatic anti-liberation tool for NationStates R/D gameplay. 
It works by polling the API for recent inbound users, then passing them to be banned with the press of a button. 
This method allows for rapid banning of inbound nations during and around update, which in turn makes defenders have a very hard time. 

To use Brimstone, simply run the Python file, enter the prompted variables, and spam space. When an inbound nation is detected, it will be prepared for banjection, which will occur on the next spacebar press.
